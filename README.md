### Hi there, I'm Durrell!

Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a software engineer interested in the intersection between music and technology, creating technology to help people, and learning new technologies!

- I love React.js and Node.js but enjoy exploring new languages
- My favorite genre of music is jazz
- If i'm not coding i'm writing music, playing video games, or studying emerging technologies
